== modes

alt+t tiling, you will see []= in status
alt+f floating, you will see ><>
alt+m monocle - one maximized window at a time
alt+space move to previous mode

== tags

tags are like workspaces

alt+<num> switch to tag
shift+alt+<num> move window to tag

<num> is 1..9

when you toggle tags youâ€™re just asking to see the exact same windows with different content.

== windows

alt+left_click move window
alt+right_click resize window

moving or resizing switches window to floating mode.

alt+middle_click switch window to titling mode

== tiling

alt+enter toggles window between master and stack
alt+j previous window
alt+k next window
alt+h shrink current window
alt+l grow current window

=== increasing/decreasing master

Let's assume the we have opened 3 windows. One window is master and other stacked.

1. alt+d 0 master, windows layed horizontally
2. alt+i 1 master, windows in master+stack mode
3. alt+i 2 masters, windows layed horizontally
4. alt+i 3 masters, windows layed horizontally
5. alt+i 4 masters, windows layed horizontally

Now to get back to one master, we have to press alt+d 3 times.

Number of masters is applied to all tags.

But doesn't occupy whole space. Resize it and on next run, it should.
