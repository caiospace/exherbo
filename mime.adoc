Some env vars may cause xdg-open to behave different https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Environment_Variables

xdg-open detect Gnome and then calls

gnome-open ~
----

You can do

----
sh -x /usr/bin/xdg-open ~
----

to see what the script does to perform the requested action.

It seems that the reason for differences between xdg-open behavior on different desktops is that xdg does not use it's own database but updates the databases of the desktop.
